## Sweave/TeX template for beamer presentations


This Sweave template for beamer presentations uses three colors, mainly a theme color (blue), an alert color (orange) and a third color (green) that are easily customizable. R code and outputs match the colors defined in the template.
    
If you want to add R codes and outputs in your slides, use the Sweave (.Rnw) file so the colors of them will fit with the theme of the beamer. Otherwise you can use either the Sweave or TeX (.tex) file.
